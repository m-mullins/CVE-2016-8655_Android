# CVE-2016-5195 GoldFish 3.4
* This works on the goldfish 3.4 Emulator
* Initroot: https://alephsecurity.com/2017/06/07/initroot-moto/ has been release for my device (harpia), so I have stopped porting the exploit to my device.
* I have learnt a large amount from working on this project, but initroot appears to be a better option.

* goldifsh/... has the files to execute this exploit on android.
* goldfish/runme.sh has the steps to deploy and execute the exploit
* mod_exploit/ is a kernel module that creates the exploit shell code (see expmod.c) extracted by goldfish/..
** Currently the exploit will call trace_printk to print some text to /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace for a PoC
