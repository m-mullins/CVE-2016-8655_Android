Ok so it is hard for me to test because I don't have a sim and my carrier usually enables tethering anyway.

But I did work out how to set the property net.tethering.noprovisioning=true. So basically when your phone starts up it reads in several *.prop files (including /system/build.prop) and puts them into a "store" that can then be used by several applications, ie. for tethering etc.

/system/build.prop is reset every time your reboot! Changing that file and rebooting will do nothing and the "store" will be the same every time.

However we can access this "store" after it has been loaded and update/add entries. You will need to have ADB installed for the next steps. (Google how to in case you don't, same goes for anything else you find confusing, I do not know how much you know :) )

Start a shell:
[CODE]adb shell
shell@harpia:/ $
shell@harpia:/ $getprop
....
[/CODE]

This is a list of all the system properties. You will notice that there is not one for the tethering option and our aim will be to add one.
